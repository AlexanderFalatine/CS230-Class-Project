Summary of the Client and Software Requirements:

The client, The Gaming Room, requested a web-based version of their Android game Draw It or Lose It, a game inspired by the 1980s television show Win, Lose or Draw. The goal was to redesign the game to allow cross-platform compatibility, making it accessible from various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones. The game required a scalable backend capable of handling multiple simultaneous sessions and ensuring unique names for games, teams, and players. 

Development Strengths:

One area I feel I excelled in during this process was researching what the developers needed based on their functional and non-functional requirements. I gave appropriate recommendations for each specific need and took into consideration all operating platforms that could create an environment that would meet those needs, such as the need for scalable servers, memory allocation, and security features.  

Helpful Aspects of the Design Process:

Creating the design document was helpful for defining the scope and architecture before coding. It allowed me to focus on critical features, such as real-time communication and cross-platform compatibility. This planning ensured that the implementation phase was streamlined, with fewer unexpected challenges. 

Potential Revisions:

If I were to revise the document, I would focus on expanding the system architecture section. Including a detailed diagram of the communication flow between the server and clients would better illustrate how real-time gameplay is achieved. This addition would improve the clarity of the system design for future developers and clients. 

Interpreting and Implementing User Needs:

The Gaming Room’s requirements were focused on providing a seamless and engaging user experience across platforms. By integrating web technologies like HTML5 and cloud infrastructure, I ensured the game could handle high traffic and deliver real-time gameplay with minimal latency. Understanding the user’s expectations for smooth gameplay was most important in achieving a user-friendly design. 

Importance of Considering User Needs:

It is essential to design with user needs in mind because user satisfaction directly impacts the success of the application. In this project, considering factors such as cross-platform compatibility, session persistence, and low-latency performance ensured that the game would meet user expectations, resulting in higher engagement and retention. 

Future Design Strategies:

In future projects, I plan to continue using structured methodologies such as object-oriented design with UML diagrams and iterative development. I will also place more emphasis on stakeholder feedback during the design phase to ensure the software aligns closely with client and user needs. Employing tools like Docker and microservices for distributed systems will remain a key strategy for scalable solutions.
